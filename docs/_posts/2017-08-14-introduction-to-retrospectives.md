Continuous improvement is an important topic in expert organisations to stay
competitive. It is also one of the principles behind the agile manifesto:

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
> effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

It is apparent that continuous improvement is an important topic, but how are
we actually ensuring continuous improvement and what tools are there?

One way to ensure constant development in projects is to use
retrospectives. Its purpose is to help you review your most recent
project/milestone/iteration, in order to understand what happened, what worked
well, and what corcetions and changes to make. It is not an activity of finding
fault with anyone, but rather an activity for learning from our experiences. It
is about improving your practice by reflecting on your recent events.
There are different types of retrospectives. In this first blog post about
retrospectives, I will present the different types and their characteristics.

## Project retrospective

The project retrospective is held by the end of a project. It gives an outlook
over how the project as a whole succeeded. It is important to bring enough
information from the whole project lifecycle in order to analyse all phases of
the project and not just the last weeks or month(s). The benefit of the project
retrospective is that the project can form the big picture and celebrate the
success together as well as think of what to do differently in the next
project. Here however, comes the drawback with relying only on a project
retrospective as well. It does not provide means to do corrective actions
during the project execution, which is equally important. The project team
might be split after the project and do not work together in the upcoming
project(s). One important aspect to keep in mind is to follow-up on the action
points when the project has ended (how to arrange time & resources) as well as
how to spread the lessons learned from a project retrospective to the organisation.

## Milestone/release retrospective

The milestone retrospective is almost like a mini-version of the project
retrospective, only that you focus on one project phase at the time. The
benefit compared to the project retrospective is that the team has
possibilities to address and improve development/working practices during the
project execution.

## Sprint retrospective

As the name implies, the sprint retrospective originates from Scrum. The team
holds the sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint and uses it to discuss
what they can changed to make the next sprint more productive. The sprint
retrospective addresses the following main topics:

- What went well during the sprint cycle?
- What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
- What could we do differently to improve?

This is probably the first retrospective type that introduced regular
retrospective meetings, which the team holds between rather short intervals
(less than one month).

## Kanban kata

Mike Rother introduced the Toyota Kata/Kanban kata. He studied how Toyota,
known for lean manufacturing, apply continuous improvement in their factories.
In the Kanban kata, continuous improvement integrates to the daily work. The
team has a high-level target to achieve and all work should take the team
closer towards this goal. Work is done in short iterations/experiments and
continuous PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles. A less strict method is just to
address any blockers/impediments for the on-going tasks during the daily
stand-up. This way the team ensures continuous flow on the Kanban board.

There is no right or wrong nor best or worst type of retrospectives. One should
pick such retrospectives that fits into the project. A much more important
aspect is to start arranging retrospectives in your project. Make
retrospectives part of project work. There should [always](https://hakanforss.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/are-you-too-busy-to-improve/)
be time to learn and improve in your project. In my second retrospective blog
post, I will introduce you to how one can conduct a retrospective in the
project, regardless of the retrospective type.
