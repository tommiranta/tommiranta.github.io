Feedback helps motivate a person to perform well and clarifies any deviations
between the preferred and the actual behaviour of the individual by giving the
person information on their performance. It is not only essential for
professional growth; it provides direction and increases the confidence,
motivation and self-esteem of the individual.

People not only need constructive feedback, they also need positive feedback to
know when and what they are doing well. Studies show that the feedback ratio to
get the best performance is five positive feedbacks for every critical feedback.

Getting and giving good quality feedback means that we have an accurate idea of
how we are doing at work. We all need to hear:

- what we did well; and
- what improvements we can make

## Feedback models

One can use one of the many feedback models to better structure the feedback.
Below are three different models.

### The Feedback Sandwich

This feedback tool consists of three components:

- Begin with the positive feedback.
- Then introduce the constructive or negative feedback.
- Close with specific that which builds up the learner’s trust and comfort.

The Feedback Sandwich minimises any detrimental effect the negative feedback
may have on the individual and ensures that the learner is not discouraged and
remains motivated to learn.

### Situation – Behaviour – Impact

This tool allows the learner to reflect more on their actions and understand
precisely what you are commenting on and why. It also helps them think about
what they need to change.

- Begin with defining the situation the feedback refers to.
- Follow this by the specific behaviours you want to address.
- The last step is describing how their behaviours affected you or others.

From this, the learner then has the chance to reflect on the situation and
their behaviour and discuss strategies for improvement with you.

### Pendleton’s Model of Feedback

Pendleton’s model of feedback helps make the learning experience constructive by:

- Highlighting positive behaviours first.
- Reinforcing these behaviours and including a discussion of skills to achieve them.
- Followed by what they could have been done differently.

The learner first identifies areas of improvement. After this, they can discuss
strategies to improve by discussion with the person giving the feedback.

## Giving feedback

### Preparation for giving feedback

Aim to give both positive and critical feedback in person or as bare minimum
over a call to make it more personal. Do not use email, SMS, or any other
electronic media in order to avoid possible misunderstandings. Avoid giving
feedback in an emotional state as that might affect the way you talk and
behave. Take a few minutes to calm yourself down before giving feedback so that
you do not have to regret what you have said later on.

### Characteristics of good feedback

There exists numerous good lists of what the ingredients are for giving good
feedback. Here is one recipe:

- **Specific**: It should contain specific information rather than generalisations.
- **Accurate**: It should be factual and clear.
- **Objective**: Feedback should be unbiased and unprejudiced.
- **Timely**: Give feedback as soon as possible after completion of a task. At
times, it might not be possible to give feedback immediately and it is better
to select a more appropriate time and place.
- **Usable**: Relate the feedback to goals and strategies so the individual can
improve performance.
- **Desired** by the receiver: Feedback can still be effective even for those who
don’t actively seek it, however those who are seeking feedback will often be
more motivated to improve performance.
- **Checked** for understanding: Clarify understanding with the individual to
ensure they are getting the most out of their feedback.

### Giving positive feedback

You can give positive feedback both in person and in public. Remember to tell
why or how something has helped you when you give positive feedback. Be more
specific than saying “good job” or “thank you for your help”.

### Giving critical feedback

It is usually a bit harder to give critical feedback. Here are some specific
guidelines to help you give critical feedback.

- Always give the feedback to the person that the feedback is addressed to. Do
not talk behind the persons back.
- Always give the feedback in person, do not give critical feedback to a person
in a group.
- Do not compare one’s behaviour to another.
- Do not repeat yourself.
- Only give feedback about things that the other person can affect.
- Avoid irony and sarcasm
- Avoid word such as “always” or “never”

## Receiving feedback

It is equally important to know how to receive feedback as well. Here are a few
tips to consider when someone gives you feedback:

- Show that you listen. Stop any other activities and focus on listening.
- Look at the person who is speaking in order to show that you care about
him/her and the feedback that you are given.
- Do not look for faults in the person who is giving you feedback.
- Do not get depressed.
- Do not distort the feedback.
- Stay on topic.
- Do not argue that the feedback is wrong or unjust.
- Thank for the feedback.

## Towards a feedback culture?

Ed Batista listed these four elements when building a feedback culture:

1. Safety and Trust – People must feel a sense of safety and trust. This can be
achieved by getting to know each other, talking about emotions, and making it
okay to say no if the time is not right to receive feedback (agree on a new
time for the discussion).
1. Balance – As mentioned in the beginning of the blog post the ration between
positive feedback and constructive criticism should be 5:1. You can achieve
this by offering good feedback… and stopping there, starting small (you do not
always have to have long discussions), and by praising effort not ability (e.g.
give praise even if the task failed).
1. Normalcy – You do not always have to wait for special occasions, such as
review or retrospective meetings. Just take a few minutes and make it happen.
When the safety and trust exists, it is also possible to give feedback in
larger groups.
1. Personal accountability – Be transparent, everyone should know that giving
and receiving feedback is an ongoing goal. Ask! Do not always sit and wait for
someone to give feedback. If we want to root a feedback culture, you need to
ask for it as well.

I hope that these tips will help you to give and receive feedback as well as
set a spark towards a feedback culture at your company. You can set yourself a
target to give feedback to your co-workers in your project once per week. Once
you build a habit it gets easier.
