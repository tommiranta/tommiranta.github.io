## Distributions

### Continuous vs. Discrete Values

A **continuous variable** is one which can take on infinitely many, uncountable
values. E.g. height, weight, length, time

A **discrete variable** over a particular range of real values is one for
which, for any value in the range that the variable is permitted to take on,
there is a positive minimum distance to the nearest other permissible value.
E.g. number of items, dice results, shoe size.

### Types of distributions

In a discrete distribution the value belongs to a certain category or group. It
is possible to calculate the probability for a certain value ending up in a
specific category.

A continuous distribution  is represented by a line consisting of all the
values in the sample/population. It is not possible to calculate the
probability for a certain value. Instead one must calculate the probability of
a value belonging into a certain area.

### Normal distribution

The normal distribution is also known as the **Gaussian distribution** or the
**Bell curve** (although there a many other distributions that take the form of
a bell as well).

### Skewness

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a
distribution. The skewness can be both positive or negative. A left skewed has
outlier values with regards to the distribution in its tail (left side of the
distribution), whereas a right skewed distribution has its outliers to the
right side of the distribution.

### Mean, median, mode

Given a distribution of the following values:

```shell
[2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Mean** value is the average of the sum of all values (=6 in the above example).

**Median** is the value in the middle of the index of  the sorted distribution
(=7 in the above example. Value at index position 8, as the size of the
distribution is 15). In case there is an even number of values in the
distribution the median value is the average of the two middlemost values.

**Mode** is the most frequent value (=8 in the above example).

## Central Limit Theorem

### Population and sample

![Simple Random Sample](/assets/images/2018-09-30-statistics/simple_random_sampling.png)

Image source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics))

#### Population parameters

$$
N = \text{size}
\\
\mu_\ = \text{mean value}
\\
\sigma = \text{standard deviation}
$$

#### Sample statistics

$$
n = \text{size}
\\
\bar{x} = \text{mean value}
\\
s = \text{standard deviation}
$$

### Central limit theorem

![Central Limit Theorem](/assets/images/2018-09-30-statistics\central_limit_theorem.png)

Image source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)

#### Sampling distribution

The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is

$$
\sigma_\bar x = \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}}
$$
where
$$
\mu_\bar x = \mu = \text{mean value}
\\
\sigma = \text{standard deviation of the population}
\\
n = \text{sample size}
$$

### Z-score

#### One sample

Given a value x one can calculate the Z value

$$
z_i = \frac {x_i-\mu} {\sigma}
$$

where

$$
\mu\text{ is the mean of the population}
\\
\sigma\text{ is the standard deviation of the population}
$$

#### Sample distribution

Given a mean value x

$$
z = \frac {\bar x-\mu} {\sigma_\bar x}
$$

where

$$
\mu\text{ is the mean of the population}
\\
\sigma_\bar x\text{ is the standard deviation of the sample}
$$

#### Z Table

[Link to Z Table](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/Tables/Ztable.pdf)

#### Z-score example

You are a Business Analyst working for a delivery services company.

A business client has requested a large freight to be transported urgently from
Denver to Salt Lake City. When asked about the weight of the cargo they could
not supply the exact weight, however they have specified that there are a total
of 36 boxes.

From prior experience with this client you know that this type of cargo follows
a distribution with a mean of 72 lb and a std. dev. of 3 lb.

The only plane you currently have at Denver is a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan with
a max cargo weight of 2,630 lb.

Based on this information what is the probability that all of the cargo can be
safely loaded onto the plane and transported?

$$
\mu_\bar x = \mu = 72
\\
\text { }
\\
\sigma_\bar x = \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} = \frac {3} {\sqrt{36}} = 0.5
\\
\text { }
\\
\text{Plane capacity} = 2,640 lb
\\
x_{crit} = \frac {2,640\ lb} {36\ boxes} =\ 73.06\ lb/box
\\
\text { }
\\
z = \frac {x_{crit} - \mu_\bar x} {\sigma_\bar x} = \frac {73.06-72} {0.5} = 2.12
\\
\text { }
\\
P(x<x_{crit}) = 0.9830 = 98.3\ \%
\\
\text{ }
\\
\text{Conclusion: There is a } 98.3 \% \text{ chance that the plane can take off.}
$$

## Hypothesis testing & statistical significance

### Hypothesis testing

1. State the null hypothesis H0 (current state).
2. State the alternative hypothesis H1.
3. Calculate the z-score
4. Check the P-value based on the z-score
5. Given a certain confidence level (usually 95%), either reject the null
hypothesis or conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypothesis.

#### Hypothesis testing example

In 2015 millennials were watching 26.5 hours of TV a week with a std. dev. of
10 hours. Today you surveyed 50 millennials that they watch 24 hours of TV per
week. Has the parameter decreased?

$$
H_0: \text{It has not decreased, i.e. } \mu \ge 26.5
\\
H_1: \text{It has decreased, i.e. } \mu \lt 26.5
\\
\text { }
\\
\mu_\bar x = \mu = 26.5
\\
\text { }
\\
\sigma_\bar x = \frac {\sigma} {\sqrt{n}} = \frac {10} {\sqrt{50}} = 1.41
\\
\text { }
\\
\bar x = 24
\\
\text { }
\\
z = \frac {\bar x - \mu_\bar x} {\sigma_\bar x} = \frac {24-26.5} {1.41} = -1.77
\\
\text { }
\\
P = 0.0384 = 3.84\ \% \lt 5\ \%
\\
\text { }
\\
\text{Conclusion: We can reject } H_0 \text{ with a 95 % confidence}
$$

### Rejection regions

Instead of checking whether the P-value for a certain z-score is under/over the
selected confidence level we can define rejection regions and compare our
calculated z-score against the z-score for P critical.

![Rejection regions](/assets/images/2018-09-30-statistics/rejection_region.png)

#### Rejection regions example

$$
P_crit = 0.05 = z_crit = -1.65
$$

In above example the value -1.77 is less than -1.65, which means that our value
is within the rejection region. **Note** in case z-score is positive the
z-score must be higher than z critical in order for the value to be in the
rejection region.

#### Common rejection region values

| Confidence level | P critical  | z critical   |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 95%              | 0.05 / 0.95 | -1.65 / 1.65 |
| 97%              | 0.03 / 0.97 | -1.88 / 1.88 |
| 99%              | 0.01 / 0.99 | -2.33 / 2.33 |

### Student's t-distribution

The t-distribution can be used instead of the normal distribution for smaller
data sets (sample size < 30). The caveat is that it has heavier tails.

![t-distribution](/assets/images/2018-09-30-statistics/t_distribution.png)

### T-Test

T test can be used in situations where the sample size smaller than 30. In case
the sample size is bigger than that it is better to rely on the Z-test calculation.

The t value is calculated with the following formula.

$$
t = \frac {\bar x - \mu} {(\frac {s} {\sqrt{v}})}
$$
where
$$
\mu  = \text{mean value of the population}
\\
s = \text{standard deviation of the sample}
\\
\bar x = \text{mean value of the sample}
\\
v = \text{number of degrees of freedom} = number\ of\ samples -1
$$

Look for the t critical value in the t table according to confidence level,
number of degrees of freedom as well as whether the the test is one tailed or
two tailed. Compare t critical with the calculated t value as with the
rejection regions.

#### t Table

[Link to t Table](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf )

#### T-test example

It is recommended to walk 10,000 steps a day to be healthy. You are wondering
if on average Americans are meeting this recommendation. You surveyed 10 random
people about how many steps each of them takes per day on average and got the
following responses:

- 7,900
- 8,200
- 11,350
- 10,150
- 8,200
- 9,600
- 6,950
- 6,200
- 8,950
- 8,450

It is evident that within your sample on average respondents are taking less
than 10,000 steps. But can you infer the same for the whole population of America?

$$
H_0: \text{# of steps is at least met, i.e. } \mu \ge 10,000
\\
H_1: \text{# of steps is not met, i.e. } \mu \lt 10,000
\\
\text { }
\\
\mu = 10,000
\\
\text { }
\\
s = 1,428.36
\\
\text { }
\\
\bar x = 8,595
\\
\text { }
\\
t = \frac {\bar x - \mu} {(\frac {s} {\sqrt{v}})} = \frac {8,595-10,000} {(\frac {1,428.36} {\sqrt{9}})} = -2.95
\\
\text { }
\\
t_{crit\ 0.95,v=9} = -1.833
\\
\text { }
\\
t < t_{crit\ 0.95,v=9}
\\
\text{ }
\\
\text{Conclusion: We can reject } H_0 \text{ with a 95 % confidence}
$$

### 1-Tailed and 2-Tailed Test

One-tailed test is used to test statistical significance in one direction and
two-tailed test is used to test statistical significance in two directions.  A
two-tailed test will test both if the mean is significantly greater than *x*
and if the mean significantly less than *x*.

![Comparison between 1-tailed and 2-tailed test](/assets/images/2018-09-30-statistics/one_and_two_tailed_regions.png)

Notice the difference in hypothesis for a 2-tailed test.

$$
H_0: \text{x has not changed, i.e. } \mu = value
\\
H_1: \text{x has changed, i.e. } \mu \ne value
$$
