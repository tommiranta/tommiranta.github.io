I currently work as a data engineer as [Leadfeeder](https://leadfeeder.com) and love
working with data. I've worked in the tech industry for almost two decades and
have learned the importance of relying on data and data visualisations to make
better decisions. It is equally essential to be able to communicate this
clearly with everyone involved. Making data-driven decisions successfully needs
involvement from the stakeholder to the expert.

I believe that regardless of what technologies are available at our disposal we
first have to make sure that we are working on the right problem and ensure
that everyone understands each other. Once we know the issue at hand, we can
find the correct technical solutions to solve the problem!

In ths blog I share my journey into the world of data.
